	<h1>AIRBUS A320 FAMILY</h1>
	<body>
		<p>The Airbus A320 family are narrow-body airliners designed and produced by Airbus. 
			The A320 was launched in March 1984, first flew on 22 February 1987, and was introduced in April 1988 by Air France.

			The first member of the family was followed by the longer A321 (first delivered in January 1994), the shorter A319 (April 1996), and the even shorter A318 (July 2003).

			Final assembly takes place in Toulouse in France; Hamburg in Germany; Tianjin in China since 2009; and in Mobile, Alabama in the United States since April 2016.

			The twinjet has a six-abreast cross-section and is powered by either CFM56 or IAE V2500 turbofans, except the CFM56/PW6000 powered A318. 
			The family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire and side-stick flight controls in airliners.

			Variants offer maximum take-off weights from 68 to 93.5 t (150,000 to 206,000 lb), to cover a 5,740–6,940 km (3,100–3,750 nmi) range. 
			The 31.4 m (103 ft) long A318 typically accommodates 107 to 132 passengers. The 124-156 seats A319 is 33.8 m (111 ft) long. 
			The A320 is 37.6 m (123 ft) long and can accommodate 150 to 186 passengers. The 44.5 m (146 ft) A321 offers 185 to 230 seats. The Airbus Corporate Jets are business jet versions.

			In December 2010, Airbus announced the re-engined A320neo (new engine option), which entered service with Lufthansa in January 2016. 
			With more efficient turbofans and improvements including sharklets, it offers up to 15% better fuel economy. Earlier A320s are now called A320ceo (current engine option).
			American Airlines is the largest A320 operator with 435 aeroplanes in its fleet. In October 2019, the A320 family surpassed the Boeing 737 to become the highest-selling airliner.

			As of August 2021, a total of 10,004 aircraft had been delivered to more than 330 operators, with 9,411 aircraft in service. Orders pending were 5,686, for a total of 15,690 orders. 
			The A320ceo initially competed with the 737 Classic and the MD-80, then their successors, the 737 Next Generation and the MD-90, while the 737 MAX is Boeing's response to the A320neo.
		</p>
		<p>The baseline A320 has given rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318, to 220, on the A321. 
			They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. 
			An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military versions like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 
			30 September 2017.

			Technically, the name "A320" only refers to the original mid-sized aircraft, but it is often informally used to indicate any of the A318/A319/A320/A321 family. 
			All variants are able to be ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) certified for 180 minutes since 2004 (EASA) and 2006 (FAA). With launch of the new Airbus A320neo project, 
			the previous members of the Airbus A320 family received the "current engine option" or "CEO" name.
