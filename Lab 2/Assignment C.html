					The PlayStation Spyro trilogy remains one of the most popular series released for the system. 
					While there were also titles released for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and other platforms, none of them 
					were developed by Insomniac Games and failed to garner as much fame among fans as the original trilogy. 
					Notably, the original trilogy has been fully remastered and released as a combined game 
					under the title of Spyro: Reignited Trilogy for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows and Nintendo Switch.
