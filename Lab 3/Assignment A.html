					The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working sled dog breed. The breed belongs
					to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double 
					coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than 
					the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute.
					<p class="pulledquote">Originated in Northeast Asia</p>
					Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the 
					Chukchi people of Siberia for sled pulling, and companionship. It is an 
					active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely 
					cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic.

					William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, 
					during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work the mining fields 
					and for expeditions through otherwise impassable terrain. Today, the Siberian
					Husky is typically kept as a house pet, though they are still frequently 
					used as sled dogs by competitive and recreational mushers.

				<p>
					The Siberian Husky was originally developed by the Chukchi people of the 
					Chukchi Peninsula in eastern Siberia. They were brought to Nome, Alaska in 
					1908 to serve as working sled dogs, and were eventually developed and used 
					for sled dog racing.

					In 2015, a DNA study indicated that the Siberian 
					Husky, the Alaskan Malamute and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic 
					relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from 
					Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog 
					and the Greenland Dog. 
					In North America, the Siberian Husky and the Malamute 
					both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed
					<p class="pulledquote">Originally developed by the Chukchi people</p>significantly 
					to the Alaskan husky, which was developed through crossing with European 
					breeds. Siberian Huskies show an genetic affinity with historical East 
					Siberian dogs and ancient Lake Baikal dogs, and can be traced to a lineage 
					which is over 9,500 years old.

					Several Arctic dog breeds, including the Siberian, show a significant genetic
					closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture.
					These breeds are associated with high latitudes - the Siberian Husky and 
					Greenland Dog, also associated with arctic human populations and to a lesser
					extent, the Shar-Pei and Finnish Spitz. There is data to indicate admixture
					of between 1-3% between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog 
					population of these four high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have
					provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation 
					beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also 
					indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one 
					region.

					The Husky usually howls instead of barking. They have been described 
					as escape artists, which can include digging under, chewing through, or 
					even jumping over fences.
					Because the Siberian Husky had been raised in a family setting by the 
					Chukchi and not left to fend for themselves, they could be trusted with 
					children. The ASPCA classifies the breed as good with children. It 
					also states they exhibit high energy indoors, have special exercise 
					needs, and may be destructive "without proper care".
					<p class="pulledquote">Good with children</p>
					Siberian Huskies have a high prey drive due to the Chukchi allowing them 
					to roam free in the summer. The dogs hunted in packs and preyed on wild 
					cats, birds, and squirrels, but with training can be trusted with other 
					small animals. They would only return to the Chukchi villages when the 
					snow returned and food became scarce. Their hunting instincts can still 
					be found in the breed today.

					A 6 ft (1.83 m) fence is recommended for this breed as a pet, although 
					some have been known to overcome fences as high as 8 ft (2.44 m). 
					Electric pet fencing may not be effective. They need the frequent 
					companionship of people and other dogs, and their need to feel as part 
					of a pack is very strong.

					The character of the Siberian Husky is friendly and gentle. The Husky 
					cannot be used as a hunting or guard dog. Due to the peculiarities of their 
					psyche, dogs have no aggression towards humans or other animals at all. In 
					addition, the dog often shows independence, which is a disadvantage for 
					service dogs. Attempting to teach Siberian Huskies aggressive behavior 
					can lead to mental problems in the dog. It can be dangerous for the owner, 
					because the Siberian Husky is a big and strong dog. The dog is 
					intelligent, but can be stubborn because of its independence, impulsivity 
					and inattention. To achieve obedience it is necessary to start training 
					at an early age.

					Siberian Huskies were ranked 77th out of 138 compared breeds for their 
					intelligence by canine psychologist Stanley Coren. However, the rankings in 
					Coren's published work utilized only one of three defined forms of dog 
					intelligence, &ldquo;Working and Obedience Intelligence&ldquo;, which focused on 
					trainabilityâ€”a dog's ability to follow direction and commands in a direct 
					context,
					<p class="pulledquote">Ranked 77th out of 138</p>
					specifically by trial judges in a controlled course setting. The 
					Siberian Husky's work as a sled dog, with minimal active direction from a 
					driver, and a driver's reliance on the dogs to make their own decisions in 
					poor conditions utilizes the other two forms, &ldquo;Instinctive Intelligence&ldquo; and 
					&ldquo;Adaptive Intelligence&ldquo; to a much greater extent.
